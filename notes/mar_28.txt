this course covers mathematical models and concepts for developing algorithms that can deal with some of the challenges posed by Big Data
    web data
    e-commerce
    medical data - health care
    bank transactions
    social network
    traffic, GPS
    scientific experiments
    ...
    "data is the new (crude) oil for the economy"
    look up In-Q-Tel

    not just massive.. but complex
        heterogeneous data
        incomplete data
        unstructured/semi-structured data
        graph data
        social network, semantic web
        streaming data
    not new
        seismic data acquisition
        census
        wall st hedge funds (renaissance technologies)
        governments
        banks, insurances
        scientific research




goal: data --> information
challenges:
    capture
    curation
    stoarge
    search
    time-limitations
    sharing
    transfer
    analysis
    visualization
data can be:
    massive
    non-static
    multi-modal
    incomplete
    noisy
    non-random
    unstructured
tasks:
    discovery of useful (unexpected) patterns in data
    non-trivial extraction of implicit previously unknown and potentially useful information from data
    modeling (generative, predictive)
    outliers (security threat, credit card theft)
    clustering
    classification
    object recognition
    visualiztion, dimension reduction
    "data cleaning" (denoising, smoothing, grouping)
    association rule mining (costumers who buy X often buy Y, etc.)
    collaborative filterning: users collaborate in filtering information to find information of interest (amazon, netflix)

"measure what you can measure, make measureable what you cannot measure"

metadata analysis
    idea is 100 yrs old (Karl Pearson)
    ex:
        see 3-part donahoe 50 years of data-science

recent big data startups
    Forensic Logic (crime analysis)
    23andMe (genomics) <-- genome for $100?  yeah right.  they require permission to sell your data
    ThetaRay (cybersecurity)
    Ayasdi (topological data analysis)

prereq for this course:
    linear algebra
    basic background in probability
    basic experience in programming
    basic knowledge in optimization recommended

this class is NOT about
    software development
    database theory
    specific applications
    heuristic methods that lack mathematical foundations

no reqd text.. maybe consider:
    c bishop - pattern recognition and machine learning
    f cucker, d x zho - learning theory - an approximation theory viewpoint
    and mroe

final project - either:
    describe how some of the methods you learned in this course will be used in your research
    find a practical application yourself using the methods you learnd in this course; describe how to use them; include numerical demonstrations
    a report describing a thorough numerical comparison of existing algorithms related to one of the topics of this course to a specific application

topic overview (tentative)
    basics of concentration of measure and high dimensional probability (curses and blessings of high-dimensionality)
        hypercube is a convex porcupine
    linear dimension reduction - (fast) Johnson-Lindenstrauss - sketching
    compressive sensing and sparsity
        acquisition and compression simultaneously
    matrix completion and low-rank modeling
        generaliztion of compressinve sensing
        most eigenvalues = 0 ... a form of sparsity
    optimization for high-dim. data analysis: first order methods, stochastic gradient descent
    fast randomized numerical lin. alg.
    clustering: matrix perturbation theory, k-means, graph Laplacian, spectral clustering
    diffusion maps, manifold learning, intrinsic geometry of data, nonlinear dimension reduction
    some basics on deep learning
        neural network with more than one layer

last but not least
    big data algorithsm are powerful
    use the power responsibly and carefully
